Like most schools in "**Auto**wah", Bell High school is designed for *cars*, not people, or bikes. The area directly around the school lacks *basic* bike infrastructure, like separated bike lanes, safe speed limits and intersection daylighting that would [save lives and reduce injury](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190529113036.htm) to both students and staff. Considering that most students are not in a car and are instead walking, biking, or bussing, cars should be *the lowest priority* when designing the roads around the school.
