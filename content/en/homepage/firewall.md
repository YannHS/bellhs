In the name of "Safety", the OCDSB has blocked several sevices on the school networks that actively hinder learning.

Here are some examples of Blocked services:

* **DuckDuckGo** - For aliased, no-bullshit web searches
* **Tailscale** - For students to connect to their computers at home
* **Unreal Engine** - For creating AAA-style games, for programming classes
* **Discord** - Readily used by clubs for intraclub communications
